# Eclipse Paho Mqtt Javscript Client

The following bower package is cloned from the [Eclipse Paho Mqtt Javscript repo](http://git.eclipse.org/c/paho/org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.javascript.git/tree/). It is maintained purely for simplicity and matches the version tagging in pom.xml with the parent project.

## What is it?

From Eclipse Paho website:

> The Paho project provides open-source client implementations of open and standard messaging protocols aimed at new, existing, and emerging applications for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT).

## Why?

We use MQTT in a lot of projects and we wanted a maintained bower package we could use quickly.

## Documentation

See [Reference Documentation](http://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/jsdoc/index.html).
